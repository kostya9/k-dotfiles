This is my personal dotfiles for
- neovim
- vim
- rider
- komorebi

For neovim config to work correctly, you need to have
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env variable set up
- netcoredbg installed (https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg)
- Run :Copilot auth on first launch to log in into GitHub
- Install lazygit (winget install lazygit)
